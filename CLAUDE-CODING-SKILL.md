# Claude coding skill — lora_experiments

Lessons from working in this repo, kept so future sessions don't re-discover
them the hard way. Update this file when a new lesson earns its place —
don't let it become a changelog of every session.

## 1. Colab + tqdm + subprocess don't mix

**Never run training code via `!python script.py` (bang/subprocess) in a
Colab cell if it prints a tqdm progress bar.** Subprocess stdout piping
breaks tqdm's in-place `\r` overwrite: Colab's output-capture renders every
bar refresh as its own new printed line instead of overwriting the same
line. The result looks exactly like log spam — a wall of near-identical
lines — and is easy to misdiagnose as "tqdm isn't showing up at all," when
it's actually rendering correctly, just once per step instead of in place.

**Fix: call the entrypoint in-process instead.**
```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")
from run_experiment import main as run_experiment
run_experiment(["--config", ..., "--device", "cuda"])
```
Running inside the live kernel process lets tqdm overwrite its line
correctly, and lets `tqdm.auto` pick the ipywidgets-based notebook bar
(Colab ships ipywidgets by default) instead of falling back to plain
terminal tqdm.

**If the requirement is "the progress bar is the *only* thing that
renders":** don't chase down every `print()`/`log.info()` call one at a
time. Route the module's own console logger to a file for the duration of
the run instead:
- A `quiet_console(logger)` context manager that temporarily removes the
  logger's own console `StreamHandler` (it still propagates to the root
  logger, so anything captured by a `file_logging`-style context at the
  same time still lands in that file).
- Keep this behavior scoped to the *real* run path only — a `--dry-run`/
  CPU/CI path usually has no progress bar competing for the console and
  should keep printing normally (tests may assert on that console output).

**Library noise (transformers/datasets/huggingface_hub) is a separate
problem and doesn't go through Python's `logging` module at all** — model
config dumps, "some weights were not initialized" boilerplate, and hub
download bars all bypass `logging`. Suppress these at the source, before
those libraries are first imported anywhere (including transitively):
`TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=error`, `HF_HUB_DISABLE_PROGRESS_BARS=1`,
`DATASETS_VERBOSITY=error`, plus each library's own
`disable_progress_bar()` / `set_verbosity_error()` call. Redirecting
`logging` output after the fact never touches this.

## 2. Scaling down a training sweep — what actually moves the needle

In rough order of impact, cheapest-to-implement first:

1. **Epochs.** A straight multiplier on total runtime; 3→1 epoch is often
   the single biggest lever, especially once the dataset itself is capped.
2. **`eval_samples`.** Generation-based eval (autoregressive, one example
   at a time) is far slower than training-loss logging. Cutting eval
   sample count is nearly free — it doesn't change what's being trained,
   only how precisely accuracy is estimated.
3. **Per-task generation length.** A single global `max_new_tokens` sized
   for the hardest task (e.g. multi-step reasoning) forces every task to
   pay that generation budget, even simple classification tasks that only
   ever emit one word. Splitting this by task (or schema field
   `max_new_tokens_by_task` with a fallback) is a real win with no
   accuracy cost on the tasks that don't need it.
4. **Drop the most expensive method from broad sweeps.** Full fine-tuning
   (updates every parameter + full optimizer state) dominates the compute
   budget of any sweep it's part of. Keep it only where it's the actual
   point of the experiment (a direct method-comparison baseline); drop it
   from sweeps that are really about a different axis (rank, target
   modules) and would otherwise be paying for a baseline nobody's
   comparing against apples-to-apples anyway.
5. **Thin a parameter grid.** If a sweep varies one axis across N values
   just to show a trend (e.g. LoRA rank across 6 values), 3 well-chosen
   points (low/mid/high) usually tell the same story for a fraction of the
   runs.
6. **Cap oversized dataset splits**, not all of them uniformly — check
   actual split sizes first. A single global cap sized for the largest
   split is a no-op for splits already smaller than it.
7. **Batch size, last.** Raising `per_device_train_batch_size` (memory
   permitting) reduces step overhead without changing epochs or examples
   seen — a genuine win, but the smallest one on this list, and the first
   thing to revert if you hit an OOM.

## 3. Config/test coupling in this repo

- Every experiment YAML is validated through a pydantic schema
  (`config/schema.py`), and "mini" smoke-test configs are asserted (in
  tests) to structurally mirror their "full" counterpart — same method
  list, same order, same types/ranks, just capped training numbers.
  **Changing a full config's method list requires changing its mini
  counterpart in the same edit**, and updating any test that hardcodes the
  old values (rank lists, method-type sets, run counts in
  docstrings/notebook markdown).
- **Before removing a method from a sweep, grep for it in every
  downstream consumer**, not just the config. A plotting script can have a
  hard semantic dependency on that method being present (e.g. a heatmap
  normalized against a `full_ft` baseline) — removing the data source
  doesn't crash the script, it just silently produces an empty/meaningless
  plot. That's a real design decision, not a mechanical edit: surface it
  and ask rather than deleting it quietly.
- **A glob-based test sweep is a coupling point too.** `tests/test_smoke.py`
  validates every `experiment_*.yaml` through the shared pydantic schema —
  a new experiment whose config *doesn't* fit that schema (e.g. it isn't
  even the same framework, see §6) needs a filename that deliberately
  doesn't match the glob, not a schema workaround.
- **Check for existing WIP state in a file before overwriting it
  wholesale.** A config may already be mid-edit (e.g. methods commented
  out) from earlier work. Diffing that state against what its own tests
  and its mini/full counterpart expect is the fastest way to tell
  "intentional and finished" from "abandoned mid-edit" — don't assume the
  file on disk reflects a deliberate, finished decision just because it's
  already there.

## 4. Tooling notes for this environment

- **Editing `.ipynb` files:** use `NotebookEdit`, not `Edit`/`Write`. The
  `Read` tool renders notebooks as pseudo-XML per-cell blocks (not raw
  JSON), and `NotebookEdit` operates on those same cell IDs.
- **No local Python/pytest outside Docker in this environment.** If Docker
  Desktop isn't running, there's no way to execute the test suite
  in-session — say so explicitly after a change instead of asserting tests
  pass without having run them.

## 5. Dataviz semantics follow the data's job, not just its range

Diverging color (two hues + a neutral midpoint) means "how does this
compare to a baseline" — it only makes sense when that baseline actually
exists in the data. Sequential color (one hue, light→dark) means plain
magnitude. **When a baseline that a chart normalized against gets removed
from the underlying data (e.g. dropping a `full_ft` reference run), the
chart's color encoding has to change with it** — swapping back to raw
values under a diverging/centered colormap silently produces a
meaningless plot, not an error.

## 6. Adapting a model that isn't PyTorch/HF (e.g. JAX/Flax)

Experiment 4 targets LPN, a JAX/Flax model — PEFT (used everywhere else in
this repo) only wraps PyTorch `nn.Module`s, so none of the existing
LoRA infra applies. A few things worth remembering for the next
non-PyTorch model:

- **"LoRA" without PEFT is just pytree math.** Flax modules are immutable —
  they take their params as a plain pytree argument to `.apply()`, they
  don't hold mutable weight attributes the way `torch.nn.Linear` does. So
  "adapting" one means patching that pytree (add `scale * A @ B` onto
  targeted kernel leaves, return a new pytree), not subclassing or wrapping
  any module. No changes to the vendored model's own source are needed —
  it's a pure function around its public `.apply()`.
- **Discover parameter paths by walking the live pytree; don't hardcode
  Flax's auto-generated submodule names** (e.g. `TransformerLayer_0`,
  `Dense_1`). Those names come from instantiation order in the model's
  source and are easy to get subtly wrong by inspection alone — a small
  recursive walk with a predicate (e.g. "every `kernel` leaf under a
  `MlpBlock` inside `decoder`") is both more robust and easier to verify
  than a guessed nested-dict literal.
- **Keep the framework-specific imports (`jax`, `flax`, `optax`) inside
  functions, not at module top-level**, same convention this repo already
  uses for `torch`/`transformers`/`tqdm` (see `scripts/run_experiment.py`,
  `src/training/common.py`). This keeps the new module importable — and its
  pure, framework-agnostic logic (the pytree patch itself, since `@` and
  `+` work identically on numpy or jax arrays) unit-testable with plain
  numpy — in this repo's Docker CPU image, which has no jax/flax installed
  and isn't getting them just for one experiment's dry-run path.
- **A checkpoint's bundled config can reference stale internal paths.**
  LPN's own checkpoint config used `_target_: src_v2.models.utils...` (an
  old internal module name) — instantiating it via Hydra's `_target_`
  resolution would have failed against the current repo layout. Reading the
  plain nested fields and constructing the config dataclasses directly
  (ignoring `_target_`) sidesteps this and doesn't need Hydra as a
  dependency in our own driver code at all.
- **Give the new model its own config schema and entrypoint script rather
  than shoehorning it into the shared pydantic `ExperimentConfig`.** A
  schema built around `model.name` + PEFT `target_modules` will actively
  mislead for a model where neither concept exists — a small, separate
  config class (still pydantic, still a `from_yaml` classmethod, for
  consistency) is clearer than adding a pile of "ignored unless you're
  experiment N" optional fields to the shared one.
